# AI Project
# CNN model
## Description
+ This project buld a CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model used to recognize digit from 0 to 9. Input of this model is a digit picture and output is a digit picture has been classified.
## About this model
+ This model is built base on Python.
+ Framework: tensorflow, keras, numpy, OpenCV, matplotlib.
+ Environment: Google Colab
## Setting and run the code
+ Step 1: Download folder CNN_model in github.
+ Step 2: Open Google Colab and push folder CNN_model in Google Colab.
+ Step 3: Run file main.ipynb.
## Note
+ Result in Google Colab our team had used folder main_model.model (this model has been built by our teams). You also design the number of hidden layers, activation, data training, ... suitable for your project.
+ You should setting the path correct before running the code.
## Screenshots
+ Accuracy and Loss value of this model
